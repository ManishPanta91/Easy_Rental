              Risks and responsibilities:
            </h2>
            <p>
              I am aware of the potential hazards while traveling in Nepal. I
              will carry a valid driver's license and international permit,
              comply with traffic rules, wear protective gear, and will not ride
              under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

              Cancellation policy:
            </h2>
            <p>
              All rental/tour bookings are non-refundable. No refunds will be
              given for cancellations after booking or for unused services.

            <h3 className="text-lg font-medium mt-4">Insurance:</h3>
            <p>
              Insurance is not typically included with rentals in Nepal. In case
              of accidents, injuries, or damage, the renter is fully responsible
              for all costs and liabilities.

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-2">Bike Damage:</h2>
            <p>
              The bike must be returned in the same condition as received.
              Damage (scratches, theft, accidents, etc.) will result in charges.
              If the bike or documents are not returned, the renter is
              responsible for all related costs, including transport, repair,
              food, and accommodation.
